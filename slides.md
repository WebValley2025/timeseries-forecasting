This is just a collection of tips, tricks and tools that on their own would be too small to mention. The sum of the total is greater than it's parts, as the saying goes.
With this knowledge, I will turn you into the mythical 1x developer. It also has no mention of AI, well, except this one. And the sparkles don't count. Another saying, is that, good things come in threes, so let's move on to the next slide. lol. next slide.

<!-- Is this time series data? It seems to have timestamps that correspond to values. It has some periodicity, has some outliers. Sure, right now, it isn't presented to you as a graph, but there's nothing stopping your from converting it to one. LLMs represent text as vectors, and vectors are just datapoints in higher dimensional spaces, so why not? -->
